# VebHolic_Ownership_Research
It is a research of ownership details and its source of generator and project name which have the unique queue id.

The dataset contains key columns like Project Name, Type, Capacity, Status, Location, Transmission Owner, and Queue ID. The Owner and Source columns are currently empty.

To populate the Owner and Source columns, I will:

1. Use the Transmission Owner column as an initial reference.
2. Use the Queue ID to infer ownership based on interconnection studies.
3. Assume ownership based on naming conventions and project details where possible.
4. Fill the Source column with the methodology used (e.g., "Transmission Owner Match," "Queue ID Reference," etc.).
